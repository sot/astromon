	  <h4> Distribution of aspect offsets for each detector  (Updated
	  <!--#CONFIG TIMEFMT="%x"--><!--#flastmod file="offsets-ACIS-S-hist.gif"-->)</h4> 
          <p> Using data
	  that have been processed (or reprocessed) with the alignment files 
	  released in 2007-May, we have determined aspect
	  offsets for numerous observations with X-ray sources having
	  well-determined radio or optical/IR counterparts.

	  <p>The four plots below show the distribution of aspect offsets for
	  observations from launch through 2003 to the present.  The aspect offset
	  is simply the distance from X-ray source centroid to the accurately
	  known position of the optical or radio counterpart.  This gives a
	    good estimate of astrometric accuracy for observations without
	    well-known counterpart positions.

	  <h4> Off-axis sources or observations with non-zero SIM offset</h4>
	  <p> It is important to note that observations on ACIS or HRC-S at large off-nominal
	  SIM-Z can suffer additional residual aspect offsets of up to 0.5
	  arcsec.  This is due primarily to distortion of fid light images by
	  the retroreflector collimator in the fiducial transfer system.  
          HRC-I observations at large off-nominal SIM-Z can have residual
          aspect offsets of up to 3 arcsec due to the fid light distortion
          as well as a possible rotation of the detector relative to the 
          geometry assumed in processing.

          <p>Sources which are at HRMA off-axis angles greater than 3 arcmin have
	  additional offsets due to PSF blurring and asymmetry.  A quick rule
	  of thumb in this case is that the uncertainty in absolute astrometry
	  is roughly 1/4 of the 50% encircled energy radius at the
	  corresponding off-axis angle.  This is based on the data tables
	  available in the memo <a
	  href="/cal/Hrma/PlateScale.html">Plate Scale and
	  Relative Chip Postions</a>.  A more accurate determination of
	  uncertainties could be made using raytrace simulations with <a
	  href="http://space.mit.edu/CXC/MARX/">MARX</a> or <a
	  href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/chart/">ChaRT</a>


	  <h4> Time history of aspect offsets (Updated
	  <!--#CONFIG TIMEFMT="%x"--><!--#flastmod
	  file="offsets-ACIS-S-hist.gif"-->)</h4> 
          <p> The time-history of
	  offsets for recent Chandra observations is shown below.  There are no
	  significant time-dependent residuals. For old archival data it should
	  be noted that ACIS observations taken in 1999, and particularly
	  before ~November 1999 could suffer larger offsets.  Shortly after
	  launch the alignment drifted rapidly due to outgassing of the ACIS
	  mount tabs, and the calibration does not account for this effect.

<a name="explanation"><h4> Explanation of plots</h4> </a>

The above plots show the offsets between Chandra X-ray source coordinates and
the corresponding optical or radio coordinates.  The offsets are derived as
	follows: 

<p>For every "qualifying" observation, the positional accuracy monitor 
cross-correlates detected X-ray sources with several accurate optical/radio
catalogs.  For grating observations, the central 0.4 arcmin is used, while for
imaging observations sources in the central 4 arcmin are considered.  Currently a
qualifying observation has:
<ul>
<li> Integration time less than 100 ksec.  This will probably be relaxed.
<li> Science category which is not "SN, SNR, and isolated NS", "Clusters of
     Galaxies", or "Solar System and Misc".  Observations in these categories 
     are likely to confound <tt>celldetect</tt> and produce too many spurious
	      sources. 
</ul>

An X-ray source matches the optical/radio source if the offset is less than 3
arcsec.  If a source is matched in more than one catalog, the most accurate
catalog is used, in the following order of preference: ICRS,
Tycho2, 2MASS, USNO-A2.0.

<h5> How is the offset defined? </h5>
The offsets (DY and DZ) are specified in the Chandra body coordinate system,
since they reflect drifts in hardware alignments. For orientiation, at a
spacecraft roll angle of 0.0 degrees, DY corresponds to Right Ascension, and DZ
corresponds to Declination.  The exact equations are as follows:

<pre>
# Define delta RA and dec in arcseconds
delta_RA  = (RA_catalog - RA_Xray) * cos(dec_catalog) * ARCSEC_PER_DEGREE
delta_dec = (dec_catalog - dec_Xray) * ARCSEC_PER_DEGREE

cr = cos(ROLL_NOM)   # Nominal ROLL taken from observation header
sr = sin(ROLL_NOM)

DZ = cr * delta_dec - sr * delta_RA;   
DY = sr * delta_dec + cr * delta_RA;
</pre>

<h3>Archival notes and announcements</h3>

<h4>Note about aspect offset in early 2007: (May-2007) </h4>

	  <center><table BORDER WIDTH="90%" CELLPADDING=2 >
	      <tr>
		<td COLSPAN="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFF99">
		  <b>NOTE (2007-May):</b> Chandra observations taken after
		  2006-Dec-10 and processed on or before 2007-May-14 are
		  subject to a systematic aspect offset of approximately 0.4
		  arcsec.  This is believed to be the result of a changed
		  thermal environment following the procedure to cool the ACA
		  CCD from -15C to -19C that took place between late Nov-2006
		  and early Jan-2007.  New calibration files to correct this
		  offset were installed effective 2007-May-14 and affected
		  observations were reprocessed to remove the offset.
		  Observers analyzing these observations should ensure that the
		  processing date is after 2007-May-14.

<h4>Announcement of updated alignments (May-2002): </h4>
<center><table BORDER WIDTH="90%" CELLPADDING=2 >
<tr>
<td COLSPAN="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFF99">
>NEW ALIGNMENTS RELEASED: 2002-May-02  <br></br> New alignment files were
installed in the CXC processing pipeline on 2002-May-02.  These alignments
eliminate all currently known systematic aspect offsets.  Use the <a
href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/ASPECT/fix_offset/fix_offset.cgi"> fix
offsets</a> thread to determine if your data are affected.  

<p> The new alignments are based on a major re-analysis of aspect offsets for
all detectors since launch.  Based on a decaying exponential fit to offsets
(common to all four detectors), the alignment shifts have been extrapolated out
to 2002-12, which should reduce future offsets.  The details can be found in
the technical note <a
href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/mta/ASPECT/boresight/UPDATE_2002-Apr/"> ECR:
Update CALALIGN align matrices</a>.  The new alignments also include correction
terms which improve absolute aspect for some ACIS-I and HRC-I observations done
with an off-nominal SIM-Z position.  The details can be found in the technical
note <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/mta/ASPECT/boresight/UPDATE_2002-Apr/">
