		  <b>SUMMARY</b> The overall 90% uncertainty circle of Chandra
		  X-ray absolute position has a radius of 0.8 arcsec.  The 99%
		  limit on positional accuracy is 1.4 arcsec.  The worst case
		  offset is 2.0 arcsec.  Performance varies slightly between
		  detectors.

		  <p> <em>These values apply for sources within 3 arcmin of the aimpoint
		      and with the SIM-Z at the nominal detector value based on data in
		      the last 5 years.</em>
