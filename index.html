	  This page gives the latest information the absolute positional

	  based on measuring the distances between the Chandra X-ray source
	  positions and corresponding optical/radio counterpart positions
	  from two accurate catalogs ( <a

	    <b>SUMMARY</b> The overall 90% uncertainty circle of Chandra X-ray
	    absolute position has a radius of less than 0.6 arcsec.  The 99% limit on
	    positional accuracy is 0.8 arcsec.  Out of 263 sources in this
	    analysis, the worst case offset is 1.1 arcsec.  Performance varies
		  slightly between detectors.

	  <h4> Distribution of aspect offsets for each detector</h4> Using the
	  latest aspect alignment files and the technique in the <a
	  href="http://asc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/arcsec_correction/"> fix
	  offsets thread</a>, we have determined aspect offsets for 263
	  observations spanning the duration of the mission.  <em>To achieve
	  the quoted accuracy with archival data you must also use the same fix
	  offsets thread</em>.

	  <p>The offset plots show data which have been "corrected" to reflect
	  the current alignment files.  Using the larger data set we show
	  histograms of aspect offsets for each science instrument separately.

	  <p>The four plots below show the distribution of aspect offsets for
	  select observations from 2003 through Sep 2006.  The aspect offset
	  is simply the distance from X-ray source centroid to the accurately
	  known position of the optical or radio counterpart.  This gives a
	  good estimate of astrometric accuracy for observations without
	    well-known counterpart positions.

	  <h4> Off-axis sources or observations with non-zero SIM offset</h4>
	<p> It is important to note that observations at large off-nominal
	SIM-Z can suffer additional residual aspect offsets of up to 0.5
	arcsec.  Sources which are at HRMA off-axis angles greater than 3
	arcmin have additional offsets due to PSF blurring and asymmetry.  At
	present the best discussion of these offsets is in the thread <em>"PSF
	as a function of off-axis angle"</em> in the <a
	href="http://asc.harvard.edu/chandra-users/subject.html"> Chandra Users
	Email Archive</a>.

	  <h4> Time history of aspect offsets</h4>
	    <p> The time-history of offsets for these observations is shown
	    below.  There are no significant time-dependent residuals.  It
	    should be noted that ACIS observations taken in 1999, and
	    particularly before ~November 1999 could suffer larger offsets.
	    Shortly after launch the alignment drifted rapidly due to
	    outgassing of the ACIS mount tabs, and the calibration does not
	    account for this effect.

<a name="explanation"><h4> Explanation of plots</h4> </a>

The above plots show the offsets between Chandra X-ray source coordinates and
the corresponding optical or radio coordinates.  The offsets are derived as
	follows: 

<p>For every "qualifying" observation, the positional accuracy monitor 
cross-correlates detected X-ray sources with several accurate optical/radio
catalogs.  For grating observations, the central 0.4 arcmin is used, while for
imaging observations sources in the central 4 arcmin are considered.  Currently a
qualifying observation has:
<ul>
<li> Integration time less than 100 ksec.  This will probably be relaxed.
<li> Science category which is not "SN, SNR, and isolated NS", "Clusters of
     Galaxies", or "Solar System and Misc".  Observations in these categories 
     are likely to confound <tt>celldetect</tt> and produce too many spurious
	      sources. 
</ul>

An X-ray source matches the optical/radio source if the offset is less than 3
arcsec.  If a source is matched in more than one catalog, the most accurate
catalog is used, in the following order of preference: ICRS,
Tycho2, 2MASS, USNO-A2.0.

<h5> How is the offset defined? </h5>
The offsets (DY and DZ) are specified in the Chandra body coordinate system,
since they reflect drifts in hardware alignments. For orientiation, at a
spacecraft roll angle of 0.0 degrees, DY corresponds to Right Ascension, and DZ
corresponds to Declination.  The exact equations are as follows:

<pre>
# Define delta RA and dec in arcseconds
delta_RA  = (RA_catalog - RA_Xray) * cos(dec_catalog) * ARCSEC_PER_DEGREE
delta_dec = (dec_catalog - dec_Xray) * ARCSEC_PER_DEGREE

cr = cos(ROLL_NOM)   # Nominal ROLL taken from observation header
sr = sin(ROLL_NOM)

DZ = cr * delta_dec - sr * delta_RA;   
DY = sr * delta_dec + cr * delta_RA;
</pre>

<h4>OLD announcement: </h4>
<center><table BORDER WIDTH="90%" CELLPADDING=2 >
<tr>
<td COLSPAN="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFF99">
>NEW ALIGNMENTS RELEASED: 2002-May-02  <br></br> New alignment files were
installed in the CXC processing pipeline on 2002-May-02.  These alignments
eliminate all currently known systematic aspect offsets.  Use the <a
href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/ASPECT/fix_offset/fix_offset.cgi"> fix
offsets</a> thread to determine if your data are affected.  

<p> The new alignments are based on a major re-analysis of aspect offsets for
all detectors since launch.  Based on a decaying exponential fit to offsets
(common to all four detectors), the alignment shifts have been extrapolated out
to 2002-12, which should reduce future offsets.  The details can be found in
the technical note <a
href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/mta/ASPECT/boresight/UPDATE_2002-Apr/"> ECR:
Update CALALIGN align matrices</a>.  The new alignments also include correction
terms which improve absolute aspect for some ACIS-I and HRC-I observations done
with an off-nominal SIM-Z position.  The details can be found in the technical
note <a href="http://cxc.harvard.edu/mta/ASPECT/boresight/UPDATE_2002-Apr/">

offset</a>
